# Python Collections 

## What are collections?

#### Collections in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, for example:
- lists
- Tuples
- Dict
- Sets

# Lists - mutable

- The syntax for list is: list_name = [item1, item2, item3]

`shopping_list = ["apples", "eggs", "dark chocolate", "tea", "bread"]`

###### Methods for lists:

- Add item `.append() = item`
- Remove item `.pop()`
- Replace item `list[i]= item`


# Tuples - immutable

- The syntax for a tuple is: tuple_name = (item1, item2, item3)

`essentials = ("paracetomal", "milk", "butter")`

# Dictionary and Sets
Dictionaries and sets are data collections in Python

- **Dict** - are a nother way to manage data  but can be a little more DYNAMIC 
- Dict work as KEY and VALUE
- KEY = reference ogf the object 
- Value =  What the data storage mechanism you wish to us 
- Syntax `name = {key:value}`


- **Sets** are aslo data collections
- syntax `name = {"", ""}`
- The difference between lists: sets are unordered

####### Methods for sets

- `.add()` to add item 
- `.discard()` to remove item
